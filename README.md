# i3-shift

**i3-shift** is a utility for the i3 window manager. It shifts the current workspace left or right with circular wrapping over workspace numbers 1â€“10. When executed, it renames the focused workspace to the next available number in the specified direction, discarding any previous labels.

## Build

```sh
deno compile --allow-run i3-shift.ts
```

## Usage

- Shift the workspace left:
  ```bash
  ./i3-shift left
  ```

- Shift the workspace right:
  ```bash
  ./i3-shift right
  ```

## Integrating with i3 Config

To bind the utility to key combinations in i3, add the following entries to your i3 configuration file (usually located at `~/.config/i3/config`):

```i3
# Shift workspace to the left with mod+Control+Left
bindsym $mod+Control+Left exec --no-startup-id i3-shift left

# Shift workspace to the right with mod+Control+Right
bindsym $mod+Control+Right exec --no-startup-id i3-shift right
```

> **Note:**  
> You'll need to make sure the i3-shift binary is in a directory that is included in the PATH environment variable visible to i3. You can also specify the full path to the binary in the i3 configuration file.
